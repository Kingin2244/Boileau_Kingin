<p>Originally bred by the nomadic peoples of the Chukchi Tribe, of Siberia. The Siberian Husky was developed to provide transportation over the vast frozen land. This tough, strong medium size dog was able to quickly cover long distances on very little food. They were bred to have a gentle nature and were a intrigal part of everyday family life. The relationship born of mutual need and nurtured by mutual respect existed between this dog and the Chukchi people. The Siberian lived in isolation for centuries before the outside world discovered it and bought it to other regions. The present day Siberian Husky has changed a lot since entering this country around 1900, but with in the current Siberian Husky breed the heart and drive of the beloved and much prized, Chukchi dog still lives.</p><!--paragraph tag, holds block of text, and starts a new paragraph-->
